- Ge_SAW_speeds.mat: Surface acoustic wave speed versus orientation angle for {001}, {011}, and {111} surface of pure Ge calculated using the method of Du and Zhao, npj Comput. Mater. 3 (2017) using elastic constants from Simmons and Wang, Single crystal elastic constants and calculated aggregate properties: a handbook, 2nd Ed. (MIT Press, 1971) at room temperature. Data used to confirm surface polarization at which Ge measurements are carried out.

- thermal_phase.m: Primary function used to determine thermal diffusivity from a single set of phase grating TGS measurements. Structure is [diffusivity,diffusivity_err] = thermal_phase(pos_file,neg_file,grat,start_phase,end_time), see function header for more description. Depends on subroutines, make_fft_embed_time(), fit_spectra_peaks(), and find_start_phase(), all of which are located in this directory.

- make_fft_embed_time: Function used to create filtered power spectrum from TGS data. Structure is [fft,diffusivity] = make_fft_embed_time(num_in,pos_file,neg_file,mod,strt,grat,peak), although the output 'diffusivity' is depreciated and should be ignored. See function header for input descriptions.

- fit_spectra_peaks.m: Function to identify the peak frequency in power spectra generated by make_fft_embed_time(). Structure is [peak,errs,ft]=fit_spectra_peaks(fft,plotty), and the output 'ft' is generally not relevant. Fits gaussian model to peaks in TGS acoustic spectrum to a fixed fraction of the peak height. See function header for input descriptions.

- find_start_phase.m: Function to determine the time at which the desired fixed-null point occurs in a provided shortened TGS phase grating trace. Structure is [start_time]=find_start_phase(time,amplitude,num_half_periods,grat) and the maximum fixed null-point possible to choose from is 4.

- thermal_model_plot: Function to take input parameters of the grating spacing in um, and values of alpha and beta from Eq. 6 in the manuscript to plot the model phase grating thermal response. Profiles are normalized and do not include a vertical offset. Structure is []=thermal_model_plot(grat,alpha,beta). Used to generate Figure 1.

- trace_plot.m: Script used to generate the plots for Figure 2 in the manuscript for phase and amplitude grating data at 4.8 um. Make sure to manually change directory structure to ensure proper location of files. 

- Ge_phase_thermal_process: Script used to process the thermal diffusivity from the entire set of Ge phase grating measurements. Make sure to manually change directory structure to ensure proper location of files. Used to generate Figure 5. Uses thermal_phase() and get_Ge_k().

- /BTE_variational_k/: sub-directory which includes raw data from BTE calculations of effective thermal conductivity using the variational method by S. Huberman. Directory contains raw data in 'ge_300K_1dTTG.txt', plots of that data in pdf files, and the function get_Ge_k().

	- get_Ge_k.m: Function to generate the value of effective thermal DIFFUSIVITY from BTE calculations in response to target wavelength given in um. Linearly interpolates BTE data to generate diffusivity value at arbitrary grating wavelength. Also used to generate the plots of the effective thermal diffusivity vs wavelength which are seen in Figure 5 in the manuscript.

In /tgs_data/

- Four directories storing the RAW TGS data used in this manuscript. TGS data for each measurement is stored as three individual data files with suffixes '...POS-1.txt', '...NEG-1.txt', and '...FIX-1.txt'. The 'POS' and 'NEG' files are used in the processing of data to extract material properties and the 'FIX' file is the difference between the data in those files and is retained as a record. Orientations of measurements conducted are delineated in the directory names as 'SurfaceDirection_SurfaceOrientation_vac_MeasurementType', where the surface direction is the acoustic polarization and the surface direction is the surface normal, i.e. <100>{001}. The measurement type is predominantly 'phase' for phase grating measurements, one measurement is provided in an 'amp' directory for the amplitude grating measurement presented in Figure 2.

- Each of the three phase grating measurement directories contains a directory /start_times/ where the start times for the null-point 2 start for each fit are recorded during one round of processing. These values are used to calculate the number presented in Table 1.

- The <110>{111} directory also contains a sub-directory called /start_mod_comp/. This directory contains two raw data files and one processing script

	- The files 'start_var_comp_2nd_6.txt' and 'sine_start_var_comp_2nd_6.txt' contain the raw data for the variation in best-fit value for effective thermal diffusivity with fit starting time used for generation of Figure 3. These data were generated using a slightly modified version of the thermal_phase() function which did not restrict fits to start at fixed-null points. 

	- The script start_var_process.m reads the data in the two aforementioned .txt files and generates the plot for Figure 3 and calculates some of the averages mentioned in the text related to that figure.
